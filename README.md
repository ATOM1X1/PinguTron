# PinguTron

This is a simple game I made for university in Java.

The main character is a penguin robot that can drive around
the map. He leaves a deadly trail that can destroy him and other
robots. The goal is to stay alive and eliminate all other robots.

The focus of this task was to get experience in working with
interfaces, exceptions and generics in Java.

Try it out for yourself or check out the showcase.
